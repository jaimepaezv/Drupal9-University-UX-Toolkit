## 1. Core UX Principles

These principles are the foundation of good design. Follow them to make sure your website works well for everyone.

- **Think About the User First:** Before you start designing, talk to the people who’ll use your site. Ask them what they need, what they like, and what they find frustrating. Create profiles (called "personas") for different groups, like students, teachers, or alumni. This will help you focus on what matters most.

- **Be Consistent:** Use the same fonts, colours, and layouts across your site. This makes it easier for users to find what they’re looking for. Drupal has its own design system, so stick to that to save time and effort.

- **Guide the User’s Eye:** Use headings, spacing, and images to show users what’s important. For example, make the “Apply Now” button stand out so it’s easy to find.

- **Work on Any Device:** People use phones, tablets, and computers to visit your site. Make sure it looks good and works well on all of them. Drupal makes this easier with tools for responsive design.

- **Make It Simple:** Don’t make users click through 10 pages to find what they need. Keep things short and clear, with buttons that say exactly what they do.

## 2. Information Architecture and Navigation

A clear structure and easy-to-use menus are key to keeping users happy.

- **Organise Your Content:** Use tools like card sorting to figure out how users think about your content. Group things in a way that makes sense to them, not just to you.

- **Keep Menus Simple:** Too many options in the main menu can confuse users. Use dropdowns or “mega-menus” for extra options, but keep the main menu short and sweet.

- **Make Search Easy:** Add a powerful search bar that suggests results as users type. Tools like Apache Solr can make search faster and smarter.

- **Show Users Where They Are:** Use breadcrumbs (those little links at the top of a page) to help users see where they are and how to get back.

- **Personalise Where You Can:** If you’re feeling fancy, you can show different users different menus based on who they are or what they’ve looked at before.

## 3. Content Strategy and Management

Good content is what keeps users coming back. Here’s how to make sure yours is top-notch.

- **Clean Up Your Content:** Go through your site and check what’s useful, what’s outdated, and what’s just taking up space. Keep only what matters.

- **Use Drupal’s Tools:** Drupal lets you create content types (like “News” or “Events”) with specific fields. This makes it easier to keep everything organised.

- **Be Consistent:** Write a style guide to make sure all your content sounds the same. This is especially important if different people are adding to the site.

- **Help People Find You:** Use keywords, good descriptions, and tools like schema.org to make your site show up in search results.

- **Speak Their Language:** If your university serves people from different countries, make sure your site works in multiple languages. Drupal has tools to help with this.

## 4. Accessibility and Inclusivity

Your website should work for everyone, including people with disabilities.

- **Follow the Rules:** Use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to make sure your site is easy to use. Aim for at least Level AA.

- **Make It Keyboard-Friendly:** Some users can’t use a mouse, so make sure they can navigate your site using just a keyboard.

- **Help Screen Readers:** Use tags like `<h1>` and `<button>` correctly so tools for blind users can understand your site.

- **Don’t Rely on Colour Alone:** Make sure text is easy to read, even for people who can’t see colours well. Use tools to check the contrast.

- **Describe Everything:** Add text descriptions to images, videos, and audio so everyone can understand them.

- **Make Forms Easy:** Use clear labels and instructions for forms, and make sure errors are easy to fix.

## 5. User Testing and Feedback Analysis

Testing and listening to users is the best way to improve your site.

- **Watch Real People Use Your Site:** Ask students, teachers, or others to try your site and tell you what they think. You can do this in person or online.

- **Test Different Ideas:** Use A/B testing to see which design or wording works best. For example, try two versions of a homepage and see which one gets more clicks.

- **Track What’s Happening:** Use tools like Google Analytics to see how people use your site. This can help you spot problems or find out what’s working well.

- **Ask for Feedback:** Add a “Send Feedback” button so users can tell you what they like—or don’t like.

## 6. Performance Optimization and Scalability

A slow website can drive users away. Here’s how to keep things fast.

- **Make Pages Load Quickly:** Compress images, use tools like lazy loading, and reduce the number of things your site needs to load.

- **Use Caching:** Drupal has built-in tools to save parts of your site, so it loads faster. You can also use tools like Varnish for even better performance.

- **Use a CDN:** A Content Delivery Network stores your site’s files in different places around the world. This makes your site faster for users far away.

- **Keep Your Database Clean:** Regularly check your site’s database to make sure it’s running smoothly.
